<h2>What is omstilling?</h2>
<h3>November 15th, 2015</h3>
<p>Omstilling is a norwegian word that roughly translates into "realignment". It has been bandied around in Norway quite a lot the last few years for a couple of related reasons. The most immediate has been the recent, dramatic drop in oil prices. Oil and gas make up roughly 30% of the Norwegian economy, so this is bound to have an effect. </p>

<p>A more longterm challenge is the climate change. Norway is western europe's largest petroleum producer. For a people who otherwise would like to think that they place a high value on the environment, Norway's reliance on oil and gas is an uncomfortable fact.</p>

<p>Norway, it is said, needs to change. It needs a more diverse economy, less reliant on oil and gas. A realignment.</p>

<p>This website is meant as as a source of up-to-date data on this realignment in real time. The <a href="#blog">blog</a> section gives an occasional update and analysis on the state of the economy and country. 
</p>

<p>But more important is the <a href="#data">data</a> section.  The goal is to keep an up-to-date, easy to access visual overview of economic and national trends. </p>

<p>What surprises me here is how little recovery there was in employment after the financial crisis. Norway never experienced a deep recession after 2008, but we never got back to the solid economic numbers we experienced prior to 2008 either. With starkly lower oil prices, employment is also starting to take</p>
